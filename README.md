- Focus on expanding and supporting stores established in 2018 as they show higher revenue potential.
- Investigate customer feedback to improve the average customer rating of 4.0 and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
- Focus on the inventory services & product qualities across all establishments in tier 3 cities as sales in these outlets have been stagnant for almost 8 straight years.
